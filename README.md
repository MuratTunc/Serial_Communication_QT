Restart your raspberry pi
Again open Qt creator, go to "Tools > Options > Build and Run" and go to Compilers. Add "GCC" set compiler path as /usr/bin/gcc
Normally Qt version and Debugger will be automatically set, but you can also set them
Then go to Kits (Still inside the Build and Run) and check whether Compiler, Debugger and Qt version are set
